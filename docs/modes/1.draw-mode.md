title: Draw Mode
---

### Draw Mode

Use Draw Mode on a map like this:

```js
// enable polygon Draw Mode
map.pm.enableDraw("Polygon", {
  snappable: true,
  snapDistance: 20,
});

// disable Draw Mode
map.pm.disableDraw();
```

Currently available shapes are `Marker`, `CircleMarker`, `Circle`, `Line`, `Rectangle`, `Polygon`, `Text`, `Cut`, `CutCircle`⭐ and `Split`⭐.

The following methods are available on `map.pm`:

This options can only set over `map.pm.setGlobalOptions({})`:

| Option     | Default | Description                                                |
| :--------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| layerGroup | `map`   | Add the created layers to a layergroup instead to the map. |

You can listen to map events to hook into the drawing procedure like this:

```js
map.on("pm:drawstart", (e) => {
  console.log(e);
});
```

Here's a list of map events you can listen to:

| Event                    | Params | Description                                                                             | Output                          |
| :----------------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| pm:globaldrawmodetoggled | `e`    | Fired when Drawing Mode is toggled.                                                     | `enabled`, test, `shape`, `map` |
| pm:drawstart             | `e`    | Called when Draw Mode is enabled. Payload includes the shape type and working layer.    | `shape`, `workingLayer`         |
| pm:drawend               | `e`    | Called when Draw Mode is disabled. Payload includes the shape type.                     | `shape`                         |
| pm:create                | `e`    | Called when a shape is drawn/finished. Payload includes shape type and the drawn layer. | `shape`, `layer`                |

There are also several events for layers during draw. Register an event like this:

```js
// listen to vertexes being added to currently drawn layer (called workingLayer)
map.on("pm:drawstart", ({ workingLayer }) => {
  workingLayer.on("pm:vertexadded", (e) => {
    console.log(e);
  });
});
```

Here's a list of layer events you can listen to:

| Event           | Params | Description                                                                                                           | Output                                                                                                  |
|:----------------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pm:vertexadded  | `e`    | Called when a new vertex is added. Payload includes the new vertex, it's marker, index, working layer and shape type. | `shape`, `workingLayer`, `marker`, `latlng`                                                             |
| pm:snapdrag     | `e`    | Fired during a marker move/drag. Payload includes info about involved layers and snapping calculation.                | `shape`, `distance`, `layer` = `workingLayer`, `marker`, `layerInteractedWith`, `segment`, `snapLatLng` |
| pm:snap         | `e`    | Fired when a vertex is snapped. Payload is the same as in `snapdrag`.                                                 | `shape`, `distance`, `layer` = `workingLayer`, `marker`, `layerInteractedWith`, `segment`, `snapLatLng` |
| pm:unsnap       | `e`    | Fired when a vertex is unsnapped. Payload is the same as in `snapdrag`.                                               | `shape`, `distance`, `layer` = `workingLayer`, `marker`, `layerInteractedWith`, `segment`, `snapLatLng` |
| pm:centerplaced | `e`    | Called when the center of a circle is placed/moved.                                                                   | `shape`, `workingLayer`, `latlng`                                                                       |
| pm:change       | `e`    | Fired coordinates of the layer changed.                                                                               | `layer`, `latlngs`, `shape`                                                                             |
| pm:intersect    | `e`    | When `allowSelfIntersection: false`, this event is fired as soon as a self-intersection is detected.                  | `layer`, `intersection`, `shape`                                                                        |
For making the snapping to other layers selective, you can add the "snapIgnore" option to your layers to disable the snapping to them during drawing.

```js
//This layer will be ignored by the snapping engine during drawing
L.geoJSON(data, {
  snapIgnore: true,
});
```
